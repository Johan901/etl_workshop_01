# WorkShop-01-ETL 📊

## Overview
The WorkShop-01-ETL project is a practical implementation designed to demonstrate fundamental ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) concepts in a data-driven workflow. This project simulates a real-world scenario where data is extracted from a source (CSV files), transformed for quality and consistency, and then loaded into a relational database (PostgreSQL) for analysis and visualization.

## Features 🌟
- Loading data from a CSV file into a PostgreSQL database. 📂 ➡️ 🛢️
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and Jupyter Notebook. 📊
- Data visualization using charts to identify patterns and trends. 📈
- Secure storage of database credentials using configuration files. 🔒
- Implementation and documentation on GitHub with sensitive data protection. 🌐

## Technologies Used 🖥️
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- PostgreSQL 🛢️
- Pandas 🐼
- Matplotlib 📊
- SQLAlchemy ⚙️
- dotenv (for managing environment variables) 🌐
